I work in the tech industry. This blog is used primarily for myself to sort out thoughts, and serves as a learning journal, the main audience for those articles is myself.

To put that aside, music and photography are life-long passion. They record and create truth and beauty, which constitues an important part of my living philosophy. Please take a grain of salt while reading about them as I'm not a professional in those fields, just a self-educating amateur.

Born and raised in China, have studied and worked in US since 2015. So this blog is bilingual.

#### 我信奉的做事原则

1、若能做简洁、简单，就别做复杂。
2、在苦思冥想不得其解的黑洞世界里，揉揉眼睛睡个觉，转个弯海阔天空。一件事情想不明白的时候refresh自己换个角度往往就柳暗花明又一村。
3、Think twice, do once。做事情要有大体思路和框架以后再动手做，往往事倍功半。
4、没有思路的时候可以敲敲打打以以点带面，先有猜想，先有成果，好过无从下手。这点对于理解一个问题和学习一项技能都有帮助。
5、一个以自我为中心的偏执狂最大的魅力就是TA内心的小宇宙能够与世界抗衡并改变世界。
6、做决定的时候把时间和收益跨度拉大，想想最终目的，就会剔除很多杂乱和次要的因素，做决定变得容易。
