I work in the tech industry. This blog is used primarily for myself to sort out thoughts, and serves as a learning journal, the main audience for those articles is myself.

To put that aside, music and photography are life-long passion. They record and create truth and beauty, which constitues an important part of my living philosophy. Please take a grain of salt while reading about them as I'm not a professional in those fields, just a self-educating amateur.

Born and raised in China, have studied and worked in US since 2015. So this blog is bilingual.
