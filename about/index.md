I work in the tech industry. This blog is used primarily for myself to sort out thoughts, and serve as a learning journal. Massively interested in learning more about C++ and database at the moment.

To put that aside, music and photography are life time passion. They record and create truth and beauty, which is the gist of my living philosophy.

Born and raised in China, have studied and lived in US since 2015. So this blog is bilingual.
